// What is memory leaks: Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but fails to release it back to the system after it's no longer needed. This can lead to increased memory usage over time and may eventually cause the program to run out of memory.
// Memory types:
// 1. Stack Memory: Used for static memory allocation. Variables are automatically allocated and deallocated when they go out of scope.
// 2. Heap Memory: Used for dynamic memory allocation. Memory is manually allocated and de
// allocated using new and delete keywords.
// 3. Static/Global Memory: Used for global and static variables. Memory is allocated
// when the program starts and deallocated when the program ends.
// 4. Code/Text Segment: Contains the compiled program code. This memory is read-only and shared among processes.
// How to manage memory effectively in C++:
// 1. Use smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr) to manage dynamic memory automatically
// 2. Avoid memory leaks by ensuring every new has a corresponding delete
// 3. Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles to tie resource management to
// object lifetime
// 4. Regularly profile and monitor memory usage to identify potential leaks or inefficiencies

    // These tools can help identify memory that was allocated but not properly deallocated.

    // When to use which memory type?
    // - Use stack memory for local variables with a short lifetime.
    // - Use heap memory for objects that need to persist beyond the scope of a function or have a large size.
    // - Use static/global memory for variables that need to maintain state across function calls or throughout
    // the program's lifetime.
    // - Code/Text segment is managed by the operating system and is not directly controlled by the programmer.
    // Proper memory management is crucial for efficient and reliable C++ programs.


    // Language terms:
    // 1. Memory Allocation: The process of reserving a block of memory for use by a program.
    // 2. Memory Deallocation: The process of releasing previously allocated memory back to the
    // system.
    // 3. Dangling Pointer: A pointer that points to a memory location that has
    // already been deallocated.
    // 4. Fragmentation: The condition where free memory is divided into small,
    // non-contiguous blocks, making it difficult to allocate large contiguous memory blocks.
    // 5. Garbage Collection: An automatic memory management technique where the system
    // periodically identifies and frees memory that is no longer in use by the program.
    // C++ does not have built-in garbage collection, but smart pointers can help manage memory automatically.
    // 6. RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization): A programming idiom where resource allocation
    // is tied to the lifetime of objects. Resources are acquired during object creation and released during
    // object destruction.

    // what is storage duration in C++?
    // Storage duration determines the lifetime of a variable and when its memory is allocated and deallocated.
    // There are four types of storage duration in C++:
    // 1. Automatic Storage Duration: Variables are automatically allocated and deallocated when they go out of scope.
    // 2. Static Storage Duration: Variables are allocated when the program starts and deallocated when it ends.
    // 3. Dynamic Storage Duration: Variables are allocated and deallocated manually using new and delete.
    // 4. Thread Storage Duration: Variables are allocated for the lifetime of a thread.

    // Safety and Common bugs:
    // 1. Memory Leaks: Failing to deallocate memory can lead to increased
    // memory usage over time.
    // 2. Dangling Pointers: Accessing memory that has already been deallocated
    // can lead to undefined behavior.
    // 3. Buffer Overflows: Writing beyond the allocated memory can corrupt data
    // and lead to security vulnerabilities.
    // 4. Double Free: Deallocating the same memory block more than once can
    // lead to undefined behavior. But how it happens?
    // It happens when a program calls delete or free on the same memory address multiple times.
    // or shared pointers going out of scope together.
    // This can corrupt the memory management data structures, leading to crashes or unpredictable behavior.
    // 5. Use After Free: Accessing memory after it has been deallocated can
    // lead to undefined behavior.
    // To avoid these issues, use smart pointers, follow RAII principles, and utilize
    // memory profiling tools to monitor and manage memory effectively.

//& vs && in C++
// & is the address-of operator, used to get the memory address of a variable.
// && is the rvalue reference operator, used to bind to temporary objects (rvalues) for move semantics.
