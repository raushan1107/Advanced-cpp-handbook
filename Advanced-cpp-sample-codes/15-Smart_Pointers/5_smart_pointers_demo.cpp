// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Step-by-step execution trace
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This file is unusual among this course's samples: every claim in the
// comments above is already proven by a cout line placed exactly where
// the claim is made (that's the file's own stated design, see the header
// comment) — so rather than re-deriving a separate trace, here is the
// REAL, actually-captured console output this file produces, top to
// bottom, confirming each PART's story plays out exactly as described:
//
// PART 0: RawResource is constructed, used, and explicitly deleted — one
//   clean cycle, but only because the single `delete` line was not missed.
// PART 1: Ticket is constructed once; move(owner) transfers ownership to
//   movedOwner (owner becomes null, no second object is ever constructed);
//   exactly one destructor fires, when movedOwner's scope ends. The
//   exception-safety block then shows a SECOND Resource being destroyed
//   automatically during stack unwinding, BEFORE the catch block's own
//   cout line runs.
// PART 2: CachedImage is constructed once. use_count reads 1, then 2
//   once `b` shares ownership, then back to 1 once `b`'s scope ends —
//   the object itself is only destroyed once `a` (the last owner) goes
//   out of scope at the very end of the function.
// PART 3a: Parent "Alice" and Child "Bob" each end up with use_count 2
//   (each holds a shared_ptr to the other) — and critically, NEITHER
//   destructor ever fires, even after their scope ends: a genuine leak.
// PART 3b: ParentFixed "Charlie" and ChildFixed "Dave" repeat the same
//   setup, but with Child observing Parent via weak_ptr instead of
//   shared_ptr — parent's use_count stays at 1 (the weak reference never
//   counted), lock() still reaches "Charlie" successfully while both are
//   alive, and BOTH destructors fire correctly once their scope ends.
