// Takes Line as input and converts it to a stream of words
// Compile with: g++ -std=c++17 5_stringStream.cpp -o stringStream
// Run: stringStream.exe (Windows) or ./stringStream (Linux/macOS)
// Analogy: Think of a string stream like a conveyor belt that takes a long string of text and breaks it down into smaller, manageable pieces (words) that can be processed one at a time.
// Real-world scenario: When processing user input or reading data from a file, you often need to break down a line of text into individual words or tokens for further analysis or processing. String streams provide a convenient way to achieve this in C++.

    // // Extract name and display it through local variable.
    // //can we directly use ss >> name in cout? Yes, but it would not allow us to store the
    // // extracted value for later use.
    // // By using a local variable (name), we can store the extracted value and use it later

    // // why to use stringstream to extract words from a line of text, why can't we just use find and
    // // substr?
    // // Using stringstream to extract words from a line of text is more convenient and efficient than
    // // using find and substr.
    // // 1. Simplicity: Stringstream provides a simple and intuitive way to extract
    // //    words from a line of text using the extraction operator (>>), which automatically handles
    // // whitespace and tokenization.
    // // 2. Efficiency: Stringstream is optimized for extracting words from a string, making it more
    // // efficient than manually
    // // searching for spaces and extracting substrings using find and substr.
    // // 3. Readability: Using stringstream makes the code more readable and easier to understand, as
    // // it clearly conveys the
    // // intention of extracting words from a line of text without the need for complex logic or
    // // manual string manipulation.
    // while (ss >> word) {
    //     cout << "Extracted word: " << word << endl;
    // }
    // // vs
    // string::find and string::substr
    // Using string::find and string::substr to extract words from a line of text is more manual and requires additional
    // logic to handle whitespace and tokenization.
    // 1. Complexity: You need to manually search for spaces using string::find and extract substrings using string::substr,
    // which can be more complex and error-prone compared to using stringstream.
    // 2. Efficiency: Manually searching for spaces and extracting substrings can be less efficient than using stringstream,
    // especially for longer strings or when extracting multiple words.
    // 3. Readability: The code using string::find and string::substr can be harder to read and maintain compared to using
    // stringstream.

    // What is vector?
    // A vector is a dynamic array that can grow and shrink in size. It is part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
    // and provides various functionalities to manage a collection of elements.
    // Analogy: Think of a vector like a flexible container that can hold items (elements
    // such as integers, strings, or objects). You can add more items to the container or remove some, and the
    // container will automatically adjust its size to accommodate the changes.
    // Real-world scenario: Vectors are commonly used in scenarios where the number of elements is
    // not known in advance or can change dynamically, such as storing user inputs, managing a list of tasks, or
    // handling collections of data in applications.
    // Remember to include <vector> header to use vectors.
    // How it helps?
    // 1. Dynamic Sizing: Vectors can grow and shrink as needed, eliminating
    //    the need to predefine the size like traditional arrays.
    // 2. Easy Insertion/Deletion: Vectors provide functions to easily add or
    //    remove elements from the collection.
    // 3. Random Access: Vectors allow direct access to elements using
    //    indexing, similar to arrays.

    // join with stringstream (formatting)
    // vector<string> parts = {"one","two","three"}
    // A fixed initial list of 3 strings to join together, one at a time,
    // into a single stringstream.
    vector<string> parts = {"one","two","three"};
    stringstream out;
    // for (auto &p : parts)
    //   p - each string in `parts`, by reference (no copies made) — "one",
    //       then "two", then "three", in that order.
    for (auto &p : parts)
    {
        // out << p << '|' << '\t'
        //   p    - the current word.
        //   '|'  - a literal separator character appended right after it.
        //   '\t' - a tab character appended after the separator.
        out << p << '|' << '\t';
        // out.str()
        // No parameters — returns everything written into `out` SO FAR as
        // a plain std::string; called again inside this loop each
        // iteration, so you can watch the joined string grow one word at
        // a time.
        string joined = out.str();
        cout << "joined part by part: " << joined << '\n';
    }
    cout << "--------------------------------" << endl;
    string joined = out.str();
    cout << "joined: " << joined << '\n';

    // vector<string> words;

    // // Extract words from the stringstream
    // while (ss >> word) {
    //     words.push_back(word);
    // }

    // // Display the extracted words
    // cout << "Extracted words:" << endl;
    // for (const string& w : words) {
    //     cout << w << endl;

// dry-run the code and check the output.
// Explanation:
// In this code, we demonstrate the use of string streams in C++ to extract words from
// a line of text. We use the `stringstream` class to treat a string as a stream,
// allowing us to extract individual words using the extraction operator (>>).
// We also show how to store the extracted words in a vector for further processing or display.
// Additionally, we demonstrate how to join strings using string streams for formatting purposes.

// Real-world scenario: String streams are commonly used in scenarios where you need to parse and
// process text data,
// such as reading user input, processing log files, or handling data from external sources.

// input:
// Enter a line of text: John 123 25
// output:
// Name: John
// ID: 123
// Age: 25

// if we have different input like "My name is Alice and my id is 456 and my age is 30", the output will be:
// Name: My
// ID: name
// Age: is
// This is because the extraction operator (>>) reads the input until it encounters whitespace,

// Step-by-step execution trace (the ACTIVE code — the commented-out
// sections above never run since they're comments, not code)
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// STEP 1  parts = {"one", "two", "three"}; out starts as an empty
//         stringstream.
// STEP 2  p = "one": out now contains "one|\t". joined = out.str() =
//         "one|\t"; prints "joined part by part: one|	" (the \t renders
//         as a tab in the console).
// STEP 3  p = "two": out.str() so far only ever GROWS (stringstream's <<
//         appends, it doesn't reset) — out now contains "one|\ttwo|\t".
//         joined captures that whole growing string; prints "joined part
//         by part: one|	two|	".
// STEP 4  p = "three": out becomes "one|\ttwo|\tthree|\t"; prints the
//         full three-word joined string.
// STEP 5  After the loop, `joined` is reassigned one final time from
//         out.str() — identical to STEP 4's value, since nothing was
//         added to `out` in between. Prints "joined: one|	two|	three|	".
// STEP 6  main() returns 0.
