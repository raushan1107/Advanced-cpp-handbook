# Enterprise C++ Sample Code Sequence

> **Filename convention:** each C++ sample is now prefixed with its teaching
> order, for example `1_Program1.cpp` and `2_namespaceprog1.cpp`. The concept
> names below retain their original basenames for readability; compile the
> corresponding prefixed file.

## One-Time Setup

Open the repository in VS Code:

```powershell
cd Advanced-cpp-sample-codes
code .
g++ --version
```

VS Code is the editor. g++ is the compiler. Recompile after every source change.

Standard build pattern:

```powershell
g++ -std=c++17 path\to\file.cpp -o program
.\program.exe
```

Use ./program on Linux/macOS. Prefer a fresh output name for each demo instead
of trusting a previously committed executable.

## Classroom Sequence

### 00. Toolchain and C++ version

Recap the source -> compiler -> linker -> executable -> operating-system loop.

From the repository root:

```powershell
g++ -std=c++17 cppversioncheck.cpp -o cppversioncheck
.\cppversioncheck.exe
```

Discuss main, includes, the selected C++ standard, and why a changed source file
does not change the executable until a successful build.

Root references:

- cpp_mind_map_key_values.txt: vocabulary map.
- cppMemoryTypes.cpp: memory preview.
- lambda_examples.cpp: later preview only; teach it in the Module 7 sequence.

### 01. Foundation: structs

Recap data fields, functions, value types, and C-to-C++ syntax.

Open 01-Structs and start with Program1.cpp:

```powershell
cd 01-Structs
g++ -std=c++17 Program1.cpp -o structs_demo
.\structs_demo.exe
```

Discuss struct, member access with ., input/output, and the difference between a
data record and the functions that operate on it.

### 02. Functions and namespaces

Recap declarations, definitions, parameters, return values, and std qualification.

Open 02-FunctionsLearning and run func1.cpp, then namespaceprog1.cpp:

```powershell
cd ..\02-FunctionsLearning
g++ -std=c++17 func1.cpp -o functions_demo
.\functions_demo.exe
g++ -std=c++17 namespaceprog1.cpp -o namespace_demo
.\namespace_demo.exe
```

Discuss how namespaces prevent collisions and relate to packages/modules in C#,
Java, Python, and JavaScript.

### 03. Types and modifiers

Recap primitive types, const, type deduction, references, and structured bindings.

Open 03-Datatype-modifiers in this order:

1. modifiersint.cpp
2. modifiersdouble.cpp
3. modifierschar.cpp
4. modifierconst.cpp
5. dectTypeTool.cpp
6. Contexpression.cpp
7. strucBinding.cpp

Compile one file at a time using the standard build pattern.

### 04. Conditions and iteration

Recap Boolean expressions, branches, loops, break, continue, and ranges.

Open 04-Conditional-Iterators in this order:

1. ifcondition.cpp
2. switchcondition.cpp
3. forloop.cpp
4. whileloop.cpp
5. dowhileloop.cpp
6. for-jump-continue-break.cpp
7. for-and-forrange.cpp
8. ternaryoperator.cpp

Example:

```powershell
cd ..\04-Conditional-Iterators
g++ -std=c++17 ifcondition.cpp -o condition_demo
.\condition_demo.exe
```

### 05. Arrays and 06. Strings

Recap contiguous storage, indexes, loops, character data, and string input.

Open 05-Array in this order: arr1.cpp, arr2.cpp, twodarray.cpp, jaggedarray.cpp.

Then open 06-Strings in this order: s1.cpp, stringinput.cpp, stringscompare.cpp,
stringCapacity.cpp, stringbufferarray.cpp, stringStream.cpp,
manipulatestring.cpp, cstdlibrary.cpp, regx.cpp.

Pause before regular expressions and explain why std::string is easier to use
than manually managing a character array.

### 07. Pointers and 08. Classes

Recap address, pointer, dereference, lifetime, stack versus heap, and object
invariants.

Open 07-Pointers: Checkmemoryaddress.cpp, pointer2var.cpp, pointer2pointer.cpp.

Open 08-ClassesandObjects in this order:

1. c1.cpp
2. c2withconstructor.cpp
3. destructorprog.cpp
4. staticmemandfunc.cpp
5. friendFunction.cpp
6. friendclass.cpp
7. inheritancecls.cpp
8. polymorphismcls.cpp
9. purevirtual-interfaces.cpp
10. virtualdestructor.cpp
11. vtablemechanism.cpp

```powershell
cd ..\08-ClassesandObjects
g++ -std=c++17 c1.cpp -o class_demo
.\class_demo.exe
```

The first six files support Modules 1 and 2. The last five support the planned
inheritance and runtime-polymorphism lessons.

### 09. Operators

Recap arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, increment/decrement, and
bitwise operators.

Open 09-Operators in this order:

1. Arthmeticoperator.cpp
2. Assignmentoperator.cpp
3. Relationaloperator.cpp
4. Logicaloperator.cpp
5. IncrementDecrementoperator.cpp
6. Bitwiseoperator.cpp

Use this before operator overloading on custom types.

### 10. Exceptions and 11. File streams

Recap invalid states, return codes, failure paths, and resource lifetime.

Open 10-ExceptionHandling in this order: GetStartedCode.cpp, Prog1.cpp,
customexception.cpp, customexceptionProgram.cpp, fileexception.cpp,
filehandlingexception.cpp.

Then open 11-FStream: filehandlingmodes.cpp, followed by raii.cpp.

```powershell
cd ..\10-ExceptionHandling
g++ -std=c++17 GetStartedCode.cpp -o exceptions_demo
.\exceptions_demo.exe
```

Discuss why RAII is the C++ answer to cleanup that might otherwise be forgotten
on an error path.

### 12. Containers, 13. Iterators, and 14. Algorithms

Recap choosing a data structure, traversing a range, and separating an algorithm
from the container.

Run 12-DataStrucCollections in this order:

1. vectorprog.cpp
2. listsprog.cpp
3. stack.cpp
4. queues.cpp
5. set-program.cpp
6. map-program.cpp

Then run 13-Iterators\iterators.cpp, followed by
14-Alogrithms\foreachalog.cpp, find.cpp, count.cpp, accumulate.cpp, and
sorting.cpp.

This is the Module 6 path for the student-records case study.

### 15. Smart pointers, 16. Move semantics, and 17. Threading

Recap ownership, lifetime, copying, moving, and shared mutable state.

Run:

- 15-Smart_Pointers\cppMemoryTypes.cpp
- 15-Smart_Pointers\memoryprog2.cpp
- 16-MoveSemantics\movesemantics1.cpp
- 17-Threading\thread1.cpp
- 17-Threading\thread-mutex.cpp
- 17-Threading\deadlockProg.cpp
- 17-Threading\threadpool.cpp

For thread examples on Linux, add -pthread:

```powershell
g++ -std=c++17 thread1.cpp -pthread -o thread_demo
.\thread_demo.exe
```

Bonus, not part of the curriculum: `17-Threading\6_sync_vs_async.cpp`. PART 1
(blocking) and PART 2 (single-threaded cooperative "async" via a hand-rolled
step()/while-loop scheduler, zero std::thread, zero async keyword) contrast
blocking vs. non-blocking to head off the common confusion between
"asynchronous" and "multithreaded." Use it if a learner asks "why does my
whole program freeze during a long operation, and how would async fix that
without adding threads?" — the "(Not Responding)" Windows GUI freeze is the
real-world hook in its header comment. (Added 2026-09-11, prompted by a
learner noticing PARTS 1-2 had no actual async keyword or library call:)
PART 3 adds std::async/std::future — C++'s real library-level async facility
(launches a genuine background thread, unlike PART 2). PART 4 adds a minimal
C++20 coroutine (co_await/co_return — the only REAL async keywords in C++)
driven by the same step-loop shape as PART 2, guarded behind
`#if __cplusplus >= 202002L` so the file still builds and runs PARTS 1-3
under `-std=c++17`; use `-std=c++20` to get all four parts. Verified both
ways on this repo's MinGW/g++ toolchain.

### 16. Move semantics

Recap lvalue vs rvalue, `T&&`, `std::move`, and why returning a large object
by value no longer implies a deep copy.

Open 16-MoveSemantics\1_movesemantics1.cpp. This is the Module 8 (Day 5) path
for the "Move semantics" topic tab.

### 18. Networking and 19. Server/client

Recap processes, sockets, client/server roles, blocking versus non-blocking work,
and why concurrency appears in network programs.

Open 18-Multi-threaded-nw for local concurrency and socket examples —
3_server.cpp loops on accept() and spawns a detached std::thread per
connection, paired with 4_client.cpp. Then open 19-Server-Client in this
order:

1. simple_echo_server.cpp
2. simple_server.cpp
3. server.cpp
4. client.cpp
5. threaded_server_win.cpp and threaded_client_win.cpp
6. poll_echo_server_win.cpp and poll_client_win.cpp

Run a server and client in separate terminals. Several examples are Windows
specific; explain the platform dependency before attempting to port them.
This is the Module 8 (Day 5) path for the "Networking" topic tab —
19-Server-Client/2_server.cpp + 3_client.cpp for the single-exchange demo,
18-Multi-threaded-nw/3_server.cpp + 4_client.cpp for the "handle more than
one client" extension (fixed 2026-09-11: 4_client.cpp had a duplicate
`string message` redeclaration that failed to compile — removed the dead
commented-out interactive loop it was left over from).

### 20. Pipes and 21-22. Linking

Open 20-File-descriptor-pipe-stream for pipes and file descriptors.

Then open 21-StaticvsDynamicLinking and 22-LinkingMulModule to explain how
multiple source files and libraries become one application. Build from source
instead of trusting committed exe, o, a, or dll files. 22-LinkingMulModule
splits header/src/main into separate folders — build it with
`g++ -std=c++17 -Iheader main/1_main.cpp src/1_rrmathlib.cpp -o main` (the
`-Iheader` flag is required since rrmathlib.h no longer sits next to the
.cpp files).

These are the Module 8 (Day 5) path for the "Pipes & FDs" and "Linking" topic
tabs — verified buildable three ways (combined source, static `.a` via `ar`,
and dynamic `.dll` via `-shared` + `--out-implib`) on this repo's MinGW/g++
toolchain. (Fixed 2026-09-11: 20-File-descriptor-pipe-stream/1_prog1.cpp
wrote a hardcoded byte count 1 longer than its message, spilling one stray
byte into example.txt — now uses strlen() instead of a hardcoded literal.)

### 23-25. Extensions and exercises

Use 23-ReadingsystemInfo as a systems extension — the Module 8 (Day 5) path
for the "Reading system info" topic tab. Use 24-Exercises after Modules 0-3
for learner practice, and again for the Module 8 capstone: 24-Exercises/
4_nimbus_fleet_command_challenge.cpp + 4_relay_server.cpp (Capstone-Work3 —
five TODO features spanning every Module 8 topic, plus a static-linking
restructure constraint). Finish with 25-demo only after the class understands
separate compilation and linking.

### 27. RTTI (typeid, dynamic_cast)

Open 27-RTTI in this order:

1. 1_typeid_basics.cpp — typeid on non-polymorphic vs polymorphic types.
2. 2_dynamic_cast.cpp — safe downcasting, pointer form (nullptr on failure)
   and reference form (throws std::bad_cast on failure).
3. 3_rtti_usecase.cpp — a realistic use case: a heterogeneous
   `vector<unique_ptr<DiagnosticEvent>>` queue where a small dynamic_cast
   chain decides per-type alert thresholds without adding a virtual method
   every subtype would have to implement.
4. 4_progressive_rtti_walkthrough.cpp — one file, one STEP at a time, no
   complexity beyond what each step introduces; use this as the read-along
   for a first pass through the topic before the other three files.

This is the Module 8 (Day 5) "Additional Topics" lesson — added because the
Enterprise curriculum otherwise never covers typeid/dynamic_cast/RTTI/
polymorphic type identification.

### 28. Qt/QML (widgets, signals & slots, QML, Qt networking)

This is the Module 9 (Day 6) path. Every file here needs the Qt 6 SDK, not
just plain g++ — see the "Before you start — install Qt" callout at the top
of `module9.html` for the exact `pacman` package list and CMake build
commands used to actually build and (for the console ones) run these before
they were put on the page.

Open 28-Qt-QML in this order:

1. 1-widgets-click-counter/ — `QApplication`, `QWidget`, layouts, a first
   informal `connect()`.
2. 2-signals-slots-calculator/ — a custom `QObject` with its own `signals:`
   and a `Q_OBJECT`-in-`.cpp` class (note the `#include "main.moc"` line).
3. 3-qml-counter/ — pure QML, no C++ backend; `main.cpp` + `main.qml`.
4. 4-qml-calculator/ — the same Calculator class from folder 2, now driven
   from QML via `setContextProperty` and a `Connections` block.
5. 5-tcp-chat/ — `chat_server.cpp` + `chat_client.cpp`, the Qt-networking
   rewrite of Module 8's raw-Winsock relay demo (`QCoreApplication`, no
   widgets).
6. 6-udp-heartbeat/ — a `QUdpSocket` broadcast/receive snippet.
7. 7-shape-canvas/ — Module 2's `Shape`/`Circle`/`Rectangle` hierarchy given
   a `draw(QPainter&)` method and rendered in a `QWidget::paintEvent`; this
   is Module 10's "Shape Drawing (Qt GUI)" mini-project.
8. 8-nimbus-fleet-console/ — `program.cpp`, Module 9's complete try-now use
   case: a chat-style `QWidget` window (log + input + Send button) wired to
   a `QTcpSocket` that connects to folder 5's `chat_server.cpp`.

Every folder has its own `CMakeLists.txt` — `cmake -B build -S . -G Ninja`,
then `cmake --build build`, then run the executable from that same folder
(the QML demos load their `.qml` file from disk by relative path, so the
working directory matters).

### 29. Wrap-up mini-projects (Module 10)

Plain g++ toolchain, no Qt needed — these three are independent, standalone
mini-projects, not one merged program (see `module10.html`'s intro callout
for why). All three were compiled and run for the page with
`g++ -std=c++17 <file>.cpp -o <name>`.

1. 1_banking_system.cpp — `Account`/`SavingsAccount`, a custom
   `InsufficientFundsError`, `vector<unique_ptr<Account>>`, and a `transfer()`
   that withdraws before it deposits so a failed transfer never touches the
   destination account.
2. 2_library_system.cpp — the Module 10 flagship: a `Library` class with
   `find_if`-based borrow/return and a delimited-text `saveToFile()`/
   `loadFromFile()` pair, so the catalog survives the program exiting.
3. 3_performance_debugging.cpp — `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock` timing
   `vector::push_back` with vs. without `reserve()`; the page also points to
   gprof (`-pg` + `gprof`) and the Visual Studio Performance Profiler as the
   real tools for a deeper breakdown, without a from-scratch demo of either.

## Curriculum Gaps

(The earlier-noted 05-Templates and 09-Qt-QML gaps are both resolved — see
26-Templates and 28-Qt-QML above. The originally-planned folder name
"09-Qt-QML" was never created under that number since 09-Operators already
occupies it; the actual Qt/QML folder is 28-Qt-QML, numbered after 27-RTTI.)

## Teaching Rhythm

For every file:

1. Ask learners to predict the output.
2. Compile it in front of them.
3. Run it and compare the result.
4. Change one line and rebuild.
5. Explain the changed behavior.
6. Connect the result to the next handbook concept.

The numbered folders are a delivery aid. Keep the original source filenames and
teach one concept at a time.
